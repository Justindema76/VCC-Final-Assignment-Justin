The rational for choosing the MIT licence

Choosing the MIT License for your GitHub project offers a balance of permissiveness 
and simplicity, making it an attractive choice for fostering collaboration and widespread adoption. 
Its minimalistic and clear terms enable developers of all levels to understand and contribute to 
your project easily. The license's compatibility with other licenses, coupled with its clear attribution 
requirements, ensures legal clarity and encourages innovation within the open-source community. 
The MIT License's disclaimer of liability protects project owners while providing users with the 
freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software for both personal and commercial purposes. 
Overall, the MIT License promotes a thriving ecosystem of open-source software development 
by removing barriers to entry and fostering a culture of shared knowledge and innovation.
